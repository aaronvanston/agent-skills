# Creating Presentations

Build bold, minimal presentations designed for live impact or standalone reading.

## Workflow

Determine which phase applies and load the relevant reference:

1. **Outline** - structure the narrative arc and section flow: [references/outline.md](references/outline.md)
2. **Write** - bold headlines and minimal slide copy: [references/content.md](references/content.md)
3. **Design** - visual layout, typography, and composition: [references/design.md](references/design.md)
4. **Notes** - speaker notes for natural delivery: [references/notes.md](references/notes.md)

**For investor pitch decks** (standalone, async): follow [references/pitch-deck.md](references/pitch-deck.md) instead. Uses the 10-slide framework with denser copy optimized for reading without a presenter.

## Principles

- **One message per slide** - if it takes more than 5 seconds to read, cut it
- **Headlines do the work** - bold statements ("AI has no memory"), not explanations ("Discussion of AI context limitations")
- **Scale over weight** - big text at light weight (400-500), not small text in bold
- **Section colors** - each major section gets its own accent color for visual rhythm
- **High contrast** - dark (#000 bg, white text) or light (#fafafa bg, dark text) with colored accents
- **Notes prompt, not script** - scannable bullet cues for riffing, not paragraphs to read

## Standard Flow

```
1. Opening (teal)    - Title + goals (3 takeaways max)
2. Context (red)     - Current state, the tension to resolve
3-5. Core (varies)   - 3-5 slides per section, dividers between
6. Closing (teal)    - Recap + resources + Q&A
```

## Context Adjustments

- **Internal**: assume shared context, be direct, reference history
- **External**: more setup, clearer transitions, define terms
- **Recorded/async**: tighter copy, stronger signposting
