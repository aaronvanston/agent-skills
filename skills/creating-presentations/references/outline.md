# Outline

Structure the narrative arc and slide sequence before writing any content.

## Standard Flow

```
Opening -> Context / Problem -> Core Sections (2-4) -> Closing
```

- **Opening**: title + goals/agenda (3 takeaways max)
- **Context**: current state, the tension or question to resolve
- **Core sections**: 3-5 content slides each, section dividers between topics
- **Closing**: recap (one-liner per section), resources, Q&A

Sections expand or contract based on complexity. A focused talk might have 2 core sections, a complex one 4.

## Section Colors

Each major section gets its own accent color. This reinforces structure and helps the audience track position.

| Color | Hex | Typical use |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Teal | #14b8a6 | Opening, framing, recap |
| Red | #f87171 | Problems, challenges, tension |
| Purple | #a78bfa | Solutions, features, tools |
| Amber | #fbbf24 | Data, reality checks |
| Green | #34d399 | Best practices, what works |
| Blue | #60a5fa | Technical, implementation |
| Pink | #f472b6 | Highlights, special callouts |

## Slide Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Statement | Land a key point | "Speed is a feature" |
| Big statement | Maximum impact, one idea | "AI has no memory" |
| Question | Create tension | "What would we do differently?" |
| Section divider | Signal topic shift | "Where we play" |
| Goals | Set expectations | "Goals for today" |
| Data | Prove with numbers | "3x growth in 6 months" |
| Code | Show implementation | Syntax-highlighted block |
| Framework | Model or comparison | Matrix, do's and don'ts |
| Quote | Borrow authority | "What got you here won't get you there" |
| Recap | Summarize before close | Key takeaways per section |
| Resources | Link references | Grouped by section |
| Next steps | Drive action | "Where to from here?" |

## Process

1. **Ask about context** - audience, purpose, setting (live vs. async)
2. **Identify key messages** - what 3 things must land?
3. **Map the arc** - Opening, Problem/Context, Core sections, Close
4. **Assign section colors** - one color per major section
5. **Draft outline** - use the format above
6. **Review density** - cut slides that don't earn their place
